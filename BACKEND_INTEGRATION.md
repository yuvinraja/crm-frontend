## Environment Setup

Ensure your environment variables are set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Your backend URL
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Complete CRUD Operations**: All entities support create, read, update, and delete operations
2. **Real-time Data**: Components fetch fresh data from the backend
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration prevents runtime errors
4. **Authentication Flow**: Secure Google OAuth integration
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
6. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
7. **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for all forms
8. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API operations

## How to Use

1. **Start your backend server** on the configured URL (default: `http://localhost:3000`)
2. **Run the frontend**: `npm run dev`
3. **Access the application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port)
4. **Login**: Click "Continue with Google" to authenticate
5. **Navigate**: Use the sidebar to access different sections
6. **Manage Data**: Create, view, edit, and delete customers, orders, segments, and campaigns

## What's NOT Implemented (AI Features)

As requested, AI-related features have been left as placeholders:

- **AI Assistant**: The `/ai` route exists but contains placeholder content
- **AI-generated segments**: The segment builder has AI generation placeholders
- **AI campaign suggestions**: Campaign creation has AI assistance placeholders

These can be implemented later when you're ready to add AI functionality.

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Network errors**: Displayed as toast notifications
- **Authentication errors**: Automatic redirect to login
- **Validation errors**: Form-level validation with user feedback
- **API errors**: Graceful error messages with retry options

## Next Steps

1. Implement your backend API according to the OpenAPI specification
2. Test the integration by running both frontend and backend
3. Customize the UI/UX as needed for your specific requirements
4. Add AI features when ready
5. Deploy both frontend and backend to production

The CRM frontend is now fully integrated and ready to work with your backend API!
